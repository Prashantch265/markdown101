<!-- paragraphs -->
To create paragraphs, use a blank separate one or more lines of text.

This is a paragraph.

#### Paragraph best practices.

Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs. Keep lines left-aligned like this.

Linebreaks can be added just by using return key. Or we can use &lt; br &gt; tag at the end of line.

# Emphasis

We can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.

## Bold

To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

This is **bold** text.

This is b**o**ld letter.
