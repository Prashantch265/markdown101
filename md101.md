To create paragraphs, use a blank separate one or more lines of text.

This is a paragraph.

Paragraph best practices.

Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs. Keep lines left-aligned like this.

Linebreaks can be added just by using return key. Or we can use &lt; br &gt; tag at the end of line.
